var formulasV = prompt ("To figure out the voltage , current, or resistance of something there are bunch  of  different formulas. Here we will lfigure out current.  Output voltage, Current, and resistance.");//tells what i am going to do        

//This is where I ask for info
var current = prompt ("Please enter a value for current");// Asking for a number for current
var volts = prompt ("Please enter a value for volts") ;//Asking for a number for voltage
var resistance = prompt ("Please enter a value for resistance");//Asking for a number for ressistance
